# Validation

## Sync Validation

Triggered when syncing to another `Node` in the network. As `Node` is just a
container for `BlockChain`, `AccountCatalogue`, `TransactionPool`,
all three are synced.<sup>[1](#footnote_01)</sup> <sup>[2](#footnote_02)</sup>
Happens when a new `Node` is created, a `Node` has been brought back online,
or a `Node` has been desynced, most likely due to having fallen behind in
`BlockChain` length.<sup>[3](#footnote_03)</sup>

Sync validation simply involves treating missing each individual `Block`,
`Account`, and/or `Transaction` as if they are announcements received.

## Announce Validation

Triggered when announcements are received. When each unit of data
is received, be it a `Block`, a `Transaction`, or an `Account`,
it must be validated both internally and
externally.<sup>[4](#footnote_04)</sup> <sup>[5](#footnote_05)</sup>

* Internal validation: Validation does not depend on external state
  and/or context.
* External validation: Validation does depend on external state
  and/or context.<sup>[6](#footnote_06)</sup>

## Generate Validation

A `Block` is generated by `Miner`s and a `Transaction` is generated
by `Client`s. Hence `Miner`s and `Client`s are responsible for
validating what they generate.<sup>[7](#footnote_07)</sup>

In order for a generated `Block` or a `Transaction` to be
accepted by a `Node`, a generated entity must pass the same validation
required by [announce validation](#announce-validation).

In its purest form, only `BlockChain` may be synced. Depending on
implementation, `TransactionPool` may be emptied during the syncing phase
and filled with only newly announced `Transaction`s. As for `AccountCatalogue`,
the current state of all non-trivial accounts with at least
one `Transaction` history can be created and derived on the fly.

`Account` registration is implemented for only practical reasons.
For one `Account` to interact with another `Account`, it would make sense
to keep records of all `Account`s in the network. Theoretically, however,
as mentioned above, any `Account`s involved in a `Transaction` not yet
in `AccountCatalogue` can be created on the fly with little or
no detriment to the security of the network.

Ultimately, all three cases involve a `Node`'s `BlockChain` length being
shorter than what it should be. Hence the resulting syncing processes
should have little to no difference for all three cases.

<a name="footnote_04">4</a>
For example, in order for a `Block` to be added to a `BlockChain`, the `Block`
itself must be internally/structurally valid and externally/relationally appendable to the `BlockChain`.

<a name="footnote_05">5</a>
This applies not only to the top level unit such as `Block`, but also
to each subunit, such as `BlockHeader` and `Transaction`, contained
in the received `Block`.

<a name="footnote_06">6</a>
The context, hence also the requirements, may change depending on
the process a unit of data is going through. For example, `Transaction`
getting added to a `TransactionPool` and getting added to a `BlockChain`
as a part of a `Block` is under two different contexts.

<a name="footnote_07">7</a>
Technically, `Miner`s and `Client`s may generate any `Block`s and/or
`Transaction`s, doing away with validation, but will be rejected
by all honest `Node`s, so there is no point.
